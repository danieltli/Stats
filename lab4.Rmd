# Task 1
```{r}
getwd()
```

# Task 2
```{r}
spruce.df <- read.csv("SPRUCE.csv")
tail(spruce.df)
```

#Task 3

```{r}
library(s20x)
trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter, data =spruce.df, f = 0.5)
spruce.lm <- with(spruce.df, lm(Height~BHDiameter))
height.res <- residuals(spruce.lm)
height.fit <- fitted(spruce.lm)
plot(y = height.res, x = height.fit)
trendscatter(y = height.res, x = height.fit)
```

In the original plot, the curve still stays increasing, but the slope gets smaller. In the next plot, however, we see a decrease in the curve's value, which is because we are using 2 different sets of data(Height vs BHDiameter and Residuals vs Fitted).

```{r}
plot(spruce.lm, which = 1)
normcheck(spruce.lm, shapiro.wilk = TRUE)
round(mean(height.res),4)
```
Since there is a P-value greater than .05, we are able to accept the NULL hypothesis and consider error distributed normally.
Since the mean of the residual is 0, we know that it works better than the straight line model for prediction of the spruce height. We want to eliminate as much noise from the data as possible, and the straight line model leaves that in.

#Task 4

```{r}
quad.lm <- lm(Height~BHDiameter + I(BHDiameter^2), data = spruce.df)
summary(quad.lm)
```
```{r}
plot(spruce.df)
myplot = function(x){
  quad.lm$coefficients[1] + quad.lm$coefficients[2] *x + quad.lm$coefficients[3] * x ^2
}

curve(myplot,lwd = 2 , col= "steelblue", add = TRUE)

quad.fit = fitted(quad.lm)
plot(quad.lm, which = 1)
normcheck(quad.lm, shapiro.wilk = TRUE)

```
Since the p-value is .684, higher than the previous one, we accept the NULL hypothesis. 

We can see that the quadratic model better describes the data than the linear model.

# Task 5

```{r}
summary(quad.lm)
```

𝛽0 = .860896
𝛽1 = 1.469592
𝛽2 = -.027457

```{r}
ciReg(quad.lm)
```

Fitted line equation : .860896 + 1.46959x - .027457x^2

```{r}
predict(quad.lm, data.frame(BHDiameter = c(15,18,20)))
predict(spruce.lm, data.frame(BHDiameter = c(15,18,20)))
```

We can see that the predictions made by quad.lm are larger than the spruce.lm ones. 

```{r}
summary(spruce.lm)$r.squared
summary(quad.lm)$adj.r.squared
summary(spruce.lm)$adj.r.squared
summary(quad.lm)$r.squared
```
R^2 = .6569146


Adjusted R-squared refers to how well the model describes the data. We can see that the quadratic data adjusted for more variables performs better than the other ones by a large margin.

Multiple R-squared describes how well data fits a particular model. It does not depend on the amount or effectiveness of included variables. 
 
As we can see, quad.lm describes the variability in height better. The R-values of its adjusted and non-adjusted are both higher than spruce.lm

```{r}
anova(spruce.lm)
```
```{r}
anova(quad.lm)
```
```{r}
anova(spruce.lm,quad.lm)
```

Quad.lm fits the data better. It having the smallest RSS value makes it closer to the data than the others

```{r}
height.qfit <- fitted(quad.lm)

TSS <- with(spruce.df, sum((Height - mean(Height))^2))
MSS <- with(spruce.df, sum((height.qfit - mean(Height))^2))
RSS <- with(spruce.df, sum((Height - height.qfit)^2))
            
TSS
MSS
RSS

round(MSS/TSS,5)
```

The value of MSS/TSS is 0.77413.

# Task 6

```{r}
cooks20x(quad.lm )
```
